## Hosting on Github Pages

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a branch called `gh-pages`
3. Enable Pages to deploy from `gh-pages` branch.
4. Make sure Actions have permission to run on this repo. `gitbook_action.yml` workflow will automatically publish a Gitbook on the `gh-pages` branch.

## Updating a new book

Modify the following files:

- Configuration settings: `book.json`
- Table of contents: `SUMMMARY.md`
- `cover.jpg, cover_small.jpg` (cover.jpg is published as the cover image in the PDF export generated by  `.github/workflows/gitbook_action.yml`)
- `LICENSE.md`

## Installing gitbook cli

Requirements: NodeJS v10 (recommend using NVM to manage node versions)

`npm install -g gitbook-cli`

## Local development

Install local development dependencies: `bundle install`

Install gitbook plugins: `gitbook install`

Build the static website using: `gitbook build`

Build and serve on localhost: `gitbook serve`

**Note:** PDF and eBook files generate via github action, and not the Gitbook generator, therefore, PDF files will be unavailable in local development.
